# Data Engineering Playbook

A practical playbook for designing, scaling, and operating batch and real-time data systems in production.

This repository captures real-world learnings from building data platforms using **Apache Spark, Flink, Airflow, Iceberg, and AWS**.  
The focus is on **architecture decisions, trade-offs, failure modes, and performance tuning** rather than toy examples.

## What this repo covers
- Batch vs streaming architectures
- Spark & Flink internals
- Airflow DAG design at scale
- Lakehouse storage (Iceberg)
- AWS data platform patterns
- AI-driven data orchestration concepts

## Who this is for
- Data Engineers (mid → senior)
- Analytics Engineers
- Platform Engineers
- Interview preparation (system design + internals)

## Guiding principles
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Explain *why*, not just *how*
- Production-first thinking
